# VHDL Secure Locker Project
This repository contains the VHDL code for a secure locker system implemented on FPGA. The project allows users to lock and unlock a locker using a 4-digit code. This README provides an overview of the project structure, functionality, and how to use the code.

## Functionality

The secure locker system is designed to provide a simple yet effective way to secure belongings using a 4-digit code. The system offers the following functionality:

1. **Locking Mechanism**: Users can lock the locker by inputting the correct 4-digit code.
2. **Unlocking Mechanism**: The locker can be unlocked by entering the same 4-digit code used to lock it.
3. **Security**: The system ensures that only the correct code can unlock the locker.
4. **Error Handling**: In case of incorrect code entry, appropriate error handling mechanisms are implemented.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
